# 2024 Spring 李毅郎 - Computer Organization Term Project

## overall
-the goal of this project is to design a processor based on MIPS☺️

## Lab 1: 32-bit ALU
- **Objective**: Design and implement a 32-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU).
- **Tasks**:
  - Implement basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, and set-less-then of signed integer.
  - Implement logic operations: AND, OR, NOR.
  - Implement zero and overflow detection
  - Verify the ALU design through simulation.

## Lab 2: Single Cycle Processor
- **Objective**: Design and implement a single-cycle processor.
- **Tasks**:
  - Design the data path and control logic for a single-cycle processor.
  - Implement the instruction set architecture (ISA) provided.
  - Test the processor with simple programs and verify correct execution.

## Lab 3: Pipeline Processor
- **Objective**: Design and implement a pipeline processor.
- **Tasks**:
  - Design a 5-stage pipeline processor (IF, ID, EX, MEM, WB).
  - Test the pipeline processor with some testbench.

## Lab 4: Pipeline Processor with Hazard Detection
- **Objective**: Enhance the pipeline processor with hazard detection and control.
- **Tasks**:
  - Implement hazard detection and control logic to handle control hazards.
  - Integrate branch prediction to improve pipeline efficiency.
  - Verify the performance of the enhanced pipeline processor with testbenches.
